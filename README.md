Notepad++ Stuff for DM
==

Just what it sounds like, some people might find this useful.
See http://imgur.com/dgLRxHV for an example.

How to:
* Install and run NP++
* Go to "Language" > "Define your language..." and import dm_udl.xml
* Go to "Run", and type in a CLI command for compiling.

* If you're on windows 7 32-bit, here's what mine looks like (yes you need the quotes):

```CMD /K "C:\Progra~1\BYOND\bin\dm.exe C:\projects\ss13\vgstation13\baystation12.dme"```

* And here's one for windows 7 64-bit (courtesy of CorruptComputer):

```CMD /K "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\BYOND\bin\dm.exe" C:\-tg-station\tgstation.dme```

* Save that to a key combo. I use ctrl-shift-c.
* Pick a decent font (i use andale mono)
* Go to "Settings" > "Preferences" and change some settings
* (I hid all the bars, displayed line numbers and folding, and disabled current line highlighting)
* Enjoy not using piece of shit dreammaker
